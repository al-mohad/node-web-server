    <h1>My coding thoughts</h1>
    <h2>Learning coding and web design involves ‘ahaaa’ moments, balls of excitement and feeling like you are not going anywhere. The key is to keep at it, take a break or two and you will eventually 'get it’ when you least expect.</h2>
    
    <p>For example, I learnt this the other night and had not idea what lead me to this. I jumped onto YouTube after coming back from work and found two great videos which made me see that it is not that hard to create a background pulse animation and a floating
        bubble effect...next thing you know it's 3am.</p>
        
    <p>Yay for bursts of inspiration! I have been staring at these colours for ages. @_@</p>
